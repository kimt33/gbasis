        Notes
        -----
        The next level of classes will be the construction of specific arrays given a set of
        contracted Cartesian Gaussians. The keyword arguments will be different depending on its
        functionality. You should use explicit keyword arguments when defining this function, rather
        than the arbitrary number of keywords (as is done here).

        The methods `construct_array_cartesian`, `construct_array_spherical`, and
        `construct_array_lincomb` depend on this function to produce an array whose first
        and second indices correspond to the contraction (within a generalized contraction) and
        the angular momentum vector of `contractions_one`, and third and fourth indices correspond
        to the contraction (within a generalized contraction) and the angular momentum vector of
        `contractions_two`,. These other methods **will** fail with little warning if the shape of
        the output is different. Even if both `contractions_one` and `contractions_two` are
        segmented contractions, the first and third indices must correspond to the contraction.
        In other words, the shape must still be (1, L_1, 1, L_2).

        kwargs : dict
            Other keyword arguments that will be used to construct the array.
            These keyword arguments are passed directly to `construct_array_spherical`, which will
            then pass it down to `construct_array_contraction`. See `construct_array_contraction`
            for details on the keyword arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        array : np.ndarray(K_orbs_1, K_orbs_2, ...)
            Array associated with the linear combinations of given two sets of contractions.
            First index of the array corresponds to the linear combination of contractions with the
            first set of contractions, `contractions_one`. `K_orbs_1` is the number of basis
            functions produced after the linear combinations of the spherical contractions
            associated with `contractions_one`.
            Second index of the array corresponds to the linear combination of contractions
            associated with the second set of contractions, `contractions_two`. `K_orbs_2` is the
            number of basis functions produced after the linear combinations of the spherical
            contractions associated with `contractions_two`.

        Raises
        ------

            If `coord_type_one` and `coord_type_two` aare not one of "cartesian", "spherical", or a
            list/tuple of these strings.
